# Universal Stream Player

the goal is to make a player that is able to play any livestream with a buffer, record VOD and play with different speeds (e.g. 2x if watching the VOD)

currently using streamlink, gstreamer and kivy

most files are efforts in testing different player possibilities, and kept for reference in the future.
currently the main effort is in `gstreamer_player.py`
